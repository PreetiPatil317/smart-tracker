 ## Smart Service Tracker
Transparent, Fast & Effortless Public Service Request Tracking

A real-world inspired solution for bank service delays and citizen grievances.

## Overview

Smart Service Tracker is a web-based portal designed to help customers track their service requests in real-time.
Inspired by real problems faced in banks—long waiting times, no updates, confusion, and frustration—this system bridges the transparency gap between customers and service officers.

This project was developed by Team InitX (Preeti Patil & G Deepika) for the CodeFlash Hackathon (KLE Institute of Technology).

## Problem We Identified

While preparing for the hackathon, we didn’t choose a random problem statement.
Instead, we asked ourselves:

👉 “What problems do people actually face in banks today?”

After observing real customers and our own experiences, we found:

❗ Customers submit requests (ATM updates, address change, cheque book issuing) but get no updates

❗ People keep visiting the bank repeatedly just to ask “Has my request been processed?”

❗ Officers manually search files to give updates

❗ Deadlines are missed because requests are not tracked properly

This showed a clear need for a transparent, trackable, and digital request system.
