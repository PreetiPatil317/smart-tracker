# 🌐 Smart Service Tracker  
### Transparent, Fast & Effortless Public Service Request Tracking  
*A real-world inspired solution to streamline bank customer service operations*

---

## 📌 Overview  

Smart Service Tracker is a web-based system that allows **bank customers** to submit service requests and track their status in real-time—just like tracking a courier package.  

This system solves major problems customers face in banks such as:  

- No updates after submitting a service request  
- Repeated visits just to ask “Has my request been processed?”  
- Officers manually searching files  
- Delays due to poor tracking or staff overload  

This project was developed by **Team InitX (Preeti Patil & G Deepika)** for the **CodeFlash Hackathon – KLE Institute of Technology**, inspired by real interactions observed in banks.

## 🧩 Problem We Identified  

While preparing for the hackathon, we didn’t pick a random problem statement.  
We asked ourselves:  

👉 “What problems do people actually face in banks today?”

After observing real customers and our own experiences, we found:

❗ Customers submit requests (ATM updates, cheque book issue, address change etc.) but get **no updates**  
❗ People repeatedly visit the bank just to ask **“What is the status?”**  
❗ Officers manually search physical files to find customer requests  
❗ Deadlines are missed because requests are **not tracked properly**  
❗ No transparent communication between customers & officers  

This clearly showed the need for a **transparent, trackable, and digital service-request system**.
